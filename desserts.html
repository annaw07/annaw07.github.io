			<p> Everyone loves dessert, but if you could only choose one which one would you choose? I personally would choose sorbet. Sorbet is a dessert that is good for everyone. If you are lactose intollerant or gluten free there are limited desserts you can choose from, but sorbet is good for everyone. It has delicious flavors for those who prefer icecream (there is even chocolate sorbet!) and there are delicious fruity flavors for those who prefer savory.)</p>
