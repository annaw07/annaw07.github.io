			<img src="filetmignon.jpg" alt="filet mignon"img/>
			<p> Filet Mignon is the best possible main course you can have. If you are vegetarian you can have mushroom steak. With a side of mashed cauliflower and cooked vegetables you can have the best main course of your life. The juicy meat will make your mouth water as it comes out. Everyone loves a delicious cut of meat and this one is irresistable.</p>
